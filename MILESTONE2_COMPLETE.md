# Milestone #2 Implementation Summary
## LSNP Basic User Discovery and Messaging (25 points)

### ✅ **COMPLETED - All Requirements Met**

---

## **User Discovery and Presence (5 points)**

### PING/PROFILE Broadcasting System
- **PING Messages**: Periodic user discovery broadcasts every 30 seconds
- **PROFILE Responses**: Automatic profile sharing when PING received
- **User Detection**: Enhanced presence system with USER_ID-based self-detection
- **Multi-device Support**: Fixed same-IP device conflicts using unique USER_ID

**Key Features:**
- Automatic PING broadcasting for presence announcement  
- PROFILE responses with user details (DISPLAY_NAME, STATUS, LISTEN_PORT)
- Known clients tracking for efficient networking
- Cross-platform compatibility (Windows/macOS/Linux)

---

## **Messaging Functionality with FOLLOW/UNFOLLOW (15 points)**

### Follow/Unfollow System
- **FOLLOW Messages**: Establish following relationships between users
- **UNFOLLOW Messages**: Remove following relationships  
- **Token-based Authentication**: Secure FOLLOW/UNFOLLOW with proper tokens
- **Relationship Tracking**: Maintain following/followers lists

### Post Filtering by Following Relationships  
- **Selective Content**: Only receive posts from followed users
- **Privacy Control**: Non-followed users' posts are automatically filtered
- **Real-time Updates**: Immediate filtering changes when follow status changes
- **Debug Logging**: Clear indication when posts are filtered

**Key Features:**
- `send_follow(target_user_id)` - Send FOLLOW message to user
- `send_unfollow(target_user_id)` - Send UNFOLLOW message to user  
- `handle_follow_message()` - Process incoming FOLLOW requests
- `handle_unfollow_message()` - Process incoming UNFOLLOW requests
- `is_following(user_id)` - Check following status
- Post filtering in `handle_post_message()` based on following relationships

---

## **Enhanced CLI Features (5 points)**

### New Menu Options (10-13)
- **Option 10**: Follow a user - Send FOLLOW message to specified user
- **Option 11**: Unfollow a user - Send UNFOLLOW message to specified user  
- **Option 12**: Show following info - Display following/followers lists
- **Option 13**: Show posts from followed users - Display filtered posts

### User Experience Improvements
- Clear success/error messages for all social actions
- Real-time feedback for follow/unfollow operations
- Comprehensive social status display
- Intuitive menu navigation

---

## **Message Format Standards**

### FOLLOW Message
```
TYPE: FOLLOW
MESSAGE_ID: <unique_id>
FROM: <sender_user_id> 
TO: <target_user_id>
TIMESTAMP: <unix_timestamp>
TOKEN: <sender_user_id>|<expiry_timestamp>|follow
```

### UNFOLLOW Message  
```
TYPE: UNFOLLOW
MESSAGE_ID: <unique_id>
FROM: <sender_user_id>
TO: <target_user_id> 
TIMESTAMP: <unix_timestamp>
TOKEN: <sender_user_id>|<expiry_timestamp>|follow
```

### PING Message
```
TYPE: PING
USER_ID: <sender_user_id>
```

---

## **Technical Implementation**

### Core Components Modified
- **`main.py`**: Added social networking menu options and user interaction methods
- **`msg_System.py`**: Complete follow/unfollow system with post filtering
- **`network_System.py`**: Enhanced USER_ID-based self-detection
- **`vars.py`**: Added SCOPE_FOLLOW constant for social tokens

### Key Algorithms
1. **Following Management**: Set-based tracking for O(1) lookup performance
2. **Post Filtering**: Real-time filtering based on following relationships  
3. **Self-Detection**: USER_ID comparison instead of IP/port for multi-device support
4. **Token Generation**: Secure timestamped tokens for follow operations

### Test Suite
- **`test_milestone2.py`**: Comprehensive validation of all M2 features
- **`test_social_network.py`**: Interactive multi-user social networking simulation
- **All tests passing**: 100% success rate for Milestone #2 requirements
