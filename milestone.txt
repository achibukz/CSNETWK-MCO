Grading Rubric (Total: 125/100 points)
To ensure steady and verifiable progress, students may only proceed to the next milestone after successfully completing the previous one. Each milestone builds upon the functionality of the prior stage. Skipping or bypassing a milestone without approval is not permitted and would result in a grade of zero past the milestone. Make sure you save your code for each milestone. This structure is designed to reinforce foundational understanding and maintain project integrity.
